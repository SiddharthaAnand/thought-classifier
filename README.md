# Thought classifier
Find out the sentiment of your thoughts by simply typing here and clicking
a button.

## What it does?
It classifies your thoughts as positive (:)), negative (:() or neutral (:|).

## How does it do it?
We use a machine learning model which improves over time and tries
your group your thoughts as positive,  negative or neutral. You
can provide real time feedback which the model takes into account
and tries to learn and improve!

## How can I contribute?

#### Create a virtual environment first.
```
$ python3 -m venv venv
```
#### Installation
[Install postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/)

Start the postgresql service.
```
$ service postgresql start
```
For further steps to create postgres db, follow the steps at the end.
Create dev and other environment databases in psql.
```
$
```
For every change that you want to show up in staging/production, you
need to do a git push to that environment before running heroku commands.

To add heroku remotes.
```
$ git remote add stage https://git.heroku.com/thought-classifier-staging.git
```
Similarly for production as well.

To remove a wrongly added remote.
```
$ git remote remove stage
```

For this repository, the staging remote name is 'stage' and
production remote name is 'heroku'.


Set up config for staging and production databases.
```
$ heroku config:set APP_SETTINGS=config.ProductionConfig --remote heroku
```
Run the same command above for setting the staging environment.

Check environment variables in staging environment.
```
$ heroku config --app thought-classifier-staging
```
Create a database_url config variable.
```
$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev --app thought-classifier-staging
```
Check back with the same command above to see if the variable got created.
Commit and push changes to heroku staging server.
```
$ git push stage master
```
Run the migration on staging.
```
$ heroku run python manage.py db upgrade --app thought-classifier-staging
```
Notice how we only ran the upgrade, not the init or migrate commands like before. We already have our migration file set up and ready to go; we just need to apply it against the Heroku database.
Add postgres add on for production
```
$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev --app thought-classifier-production

 ! This database is empty. If upgrading, you can transfer
 ! data from another database with pg:copy

```
#### Clone the repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/SiddharthaAnand/thought-classifier.git
```
Switch directory.
```
$ cd thought-classifier/
```
This will install all the requirements/packages required to run this application.
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Try running the application.
```
python migration_code/manage.py runserver
```
If you see something like this, then congratulations the application is successfully
installed.

For working on machine learning models, you can switch to ml_code/ and start working.

## Dataset
We are using Rotten Tomatoes reviews dataset.

## Running the database commands

```
$ psql
```
To open the command prompt for postgresql.
To switch to the dev database.
```
$ \c thought-classifier_dev;
sid=> \c thoughtclassifier_dev;
You are now connected to database "thoughtclassifier_dev" as user "sid".
```
To run commands to fetch data
```
$ thoughtclassifier_dev=> select * from user_raw_data;
```

## Installation of redis
```
$ wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-6.0.5.tar.gz
$ tar xzf redis-6.0.5.tar.gz
$ cd redis-6.0.5
$ make
```

##### Troubleshooting for postgres
Error 1
```
$ psql
psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
        Is the server running locally and accepting
        connections on Unix domain socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
```

Try the following:
```
$ sudo systemctl start postgresql@11-main
```
This command should start the cluster.
You can check the status of the cluster by following command.
```
$ pg_lsclusters
11  main    5432 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/11/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-11-main.log
```
Error 2
```
$ psql
psql: FATAL:  role "sid" does not exist
```
This means there is no user named 'sid' in postgres.
To simply login, just try the following:
```
sudo -u postgres -i
```
What this does is logs you in as 'postgres' user which is the default
user in postgres.
You need to create a new role and assign to it the same rights as the
one of postgres.
Try the following:
First login as 'postgres'
```
$ sudo -u postgres -i
$ createuser sid
$ psql
postgres=# alter user sid createdb;
postgres=# exit
$ sudo -u sid -i
# createdb
# psql
sid=>
```
The db and role are named as postgres. You need to create a role in postgres
which is the username and a db. Alter command gives your role the access
rights as postgres. Then createdb command creates a db with the same name
as username. When you type psql, the db prompt is finally open!
Error 3
Installation of psycopg2
[Try steps given.](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html)

Error 4
```
File "/app/.heroku/python/lib/python3.6/os.py", line 669, in __getitem__
    raise KeyError(key) from None
KeyError: 'APP_SETTINGS'
```
This error comes because you have not set the environment variable
called 'APP_SETTINGS' for the staging/production env.
Run the command mentioned above and you should be ok.

Error 5
```
$ redis-6.0.5/src/redis-server
...
Connection refused
```
Check if you have redis-server running or not.
